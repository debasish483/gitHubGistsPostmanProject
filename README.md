gitHubGistsPostman API automation project
Hi,
Please find the API automation script created using Postman. The scripts have been designed in JavaScript and are also parameterized using the environment variables concept of Postman. Postman is an API testing tool which provides flexibility to test APIs both manually and in an automated way.
Kindly let me know if any further details are required.
Best Regards,

Debasish Das
